      The maximum allowed percentage of applications health degradation allowed
      during cluster upgrades.

      The delta is measured between the state of the applications at the
      beginning of upgrade and the state of the applications at the time of the
      health evaluation.

      The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion to
      make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits.
      System services are not included in this.

      The delta is measured between the state of the upgrade domain nodes at the

      of the health evaluation.

      The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion for
      all completed upgrade domains to make sure the state of the upgrade
      domains is within tolerated limits.
