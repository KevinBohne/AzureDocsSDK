      The maximum amount of time to block processing of an upgrade domain and

      The timeout is reset at the start of each upgrade domain. The timeout can
      be in either hh:mm:ss or in d.hh:mm:ss.ms format.

      This value must be between 00:00:00 and 49710.06:28:15 (unsigned 32 bit
      integer for seconds)
