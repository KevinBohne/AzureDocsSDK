      Boot Diagnostics is a debugging feature which allows you to view Console
      Output

      and Screenshot to diagnose VM status. **NOTE**: If storageUri is being

      specified then ensure that the storage account is in the same region and

      subscription as the VM. You can easily view the output of your console
      log.

      Azure also enables you to see a screenshot of the VM from the hypervisor.
