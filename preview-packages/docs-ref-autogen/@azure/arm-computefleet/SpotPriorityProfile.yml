      Flag to enable/disable continuous goal seeking for the desired capacity
      and restoration of evicted Spot VMs.

      If maintain is enabled, AzureFleetRP will use all VM sizes in
      vmSizesProfile to create new VMs (if VMs are evicted deleted)

      or update existing VMs with new VM sizes (if VMs are evicted deallocated
      or failed to allocate due to capacity constraint) in order to achieve the
      desired capacity.

      Maintain is enabled by default.
